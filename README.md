# RLS-QR-Regression
 This repository contains an optimized implementation of Recursive Least Squares (RLS) for polynomial regression, using QR decomposition with Givens rotations. It supports efficient real-time data updates by incrementally adding and removing data points, making it suitable for streaming applications
